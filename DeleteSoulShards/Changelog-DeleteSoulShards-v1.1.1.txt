All the cool addons have a file like this so obviously I need one too. No clue how to do this properly though.

Version 1.0.0:
Set up the hole thing. Seems to be working fine, havent found any bugs.

-----------------------------

Version 1.1.0
DeleteSoulShards.toc - minimal grammar changes
DeleteSoulShards.lua - at ADDON_LOADED checks if its this addon
		       unregisters all events and deletes all slash-commands if character is no warlock

-----------------------------

Version 1.1.1
DeleteSoulShards.toc - now saves in SavedVariables per Character and not per account
